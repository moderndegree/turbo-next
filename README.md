# Turborepo w/Next.js

This is a demonstration of a monorepo with a Next.js application running along side an Express service API.

## What's inside?

This monorepo includes the following:

### Installation

This monorepo uses [pnpm](http://pnpm.io) as its package manager. To install your dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

### Local development

To run the both apps in dev mode:

```
pnpm dev
```

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `api`: an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server
- `@repo/ui`: a React component library
- `@repo/logger`: Isomorphic logger (a small wrapper around console.log)
- `@repo/eslint-config`: ESLint presets
- `@repo/typescript-config`: tsconfig.json's used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/jest-presets`: Jest configurations

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Docker

This repo is configured to be built with Docker, and Docker compose. To build all apps in this repo:

```
# Create a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
docker network create app_network

# Start prod in detached mode
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

To shutdown all running containers:

```
# Stop all running containers
docker kill $(docker ps -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Utilities

This monorepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
